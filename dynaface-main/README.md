# Dynaface

Dynaface is a computer application and Python library that measures facial symmetry. It utilizes advanced AI for both symmetric and asymmetric faces. AI allows Dynaface to locate 97 facial landmarks automatically to conduct a variety of measures on still images and videos. Researchers can export all data from pictures and videos to CSV/Excel format for further analysis.
