# Dynaface Support

## Getting Version Information

When troubleshooting issues with Dynaface, your **macOS version**, **chip type**, and **memory size** are crucial details. To find this information:

1. Click the **Apple Menu** (ï£¿) in the top-left corner.
2. Select **About This Mac**.
3. A window will appear similar to the one below:

   ![Mac Version](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/data.heatonresearch.com/images/facial/site/mac_info.jpg)

### Recommended System Requirements

- **Chip**: Ideally an Apple **M-series** (M1, M2, M3, M4). However, **Intel chips** are still supported.
- **Memory**: **16GB+** recommended (_8GB may work but is not ideal_).
- **macOS Version**: **macOS 14+** (Sonoma or later).

If you need support or are reporting a bug, please provide these three values.

## Dynaface Not Starting

If you double-click **Dynaface** and the application does not launch, you can use the **Terminal** to diagnose the issue.

### Launching Dynaface via Terminal

1. Click the **magnifying glass** (Spotlight) in the upper-right corner of your Mac screen.
2. Type **Terminal** and press **Enter** to open it.
3. Navigate to the folder where Dynaface is located. Common locations include:

   - **Downloads**: `cd ~/Downloads`
   - **Desktop**: `cd ~/Desktop`

   Issue the following command to move to the correct directory.

   ```sh
   cd ~/Downloads
   ```

   You can list the files in the directory with:

   ```sh
   ls
   ```

4. Dynaface will be listed as `Dynaface.app`. Start it manually with:

   ```sh
   ./Dynaface.app/Contents/MacOS/dynaface
   ```

This will generate output in the terminal, which may include an error message. If you need support, **copy and paste** this output when submitting a bug report.

Example terminal output:

![Mac Terminal](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/data.heatonresearch.com/images/facial/site/mac_terminal.jpg)

2. Select **Go to Folder**.
